# my_commands
This is a file that I use when programming. Its nothing more then a bunch of commands that i update. I tend to forget them so i have a text file with them in it

```bash
alias python=python3
alias py=python3

NEWLINE=$'\n'
PROMPT="%(!.%F{red}.%F{white})%n%F{cyan}@%m %F{yellow}%d%F{reset}:"
```
